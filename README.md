You have heard of Tinder, but have you heard of TinDog?
I am using Bootstrap and CSS to create this beautiful startup landing page.
It has a Title section, as well as Features sections, a carousel to browse Testimonials, a Pricing plan section and a Call To Action section where the users get to download the app. And, finally, a nice little Footer section with the socials.
